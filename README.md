## A small engine made for a passionate newbie rust developer!

I am using this engine for learning purposes. I want to learn some rust and also the vulkan API. 
I believe a good way to train is to use a real project.

This code uses the vulkano api, which is a safe wrapper for the c++ vulkan api in Rust. Feel free to use the code, but it is still in the beginning and there is a lot of mess that I will be fixing in the future
